- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sarah-ZW
- ðŸ‘€ I love being a developer and diving into code every day.  At work, I use PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, but also enjoy branching out and learning about other languages.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving into after work self-education to make sure I'm keeping up with the latest advances and dedication to be a lifelong learner.
