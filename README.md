- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sarah-ZW
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a software developer in any language, but am particularly interested in JavaScript.  My bootcamp focused on JavaScript and its frameworks, and I      like the idea that with JavaScript I can be a full stack developer.  I learned HTML, CSS, and SQL during bootcamp as well.  I'm excited to dive into other languages as I move forward in my career.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python to add to my list of languages.
